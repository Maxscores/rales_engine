Welcome to Rails Engine! This is a project for Turing Backend Mod 3 class where we build an internal sales engine API using ruby on rails: [docs here](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine#technical-expectations)

It was built by [Tim Joo](https://github.com/Tyjoo26) & [Max Stackhouse](https://github.com/Maxscores)

## Setup
You'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/).
### Spec Harness
Initial setup must be done prior to running the [spec harness](https://github.com/Maxscores/rales_engine_spec_harness).

```
git clone https://github.com/Maxscores/rales_engine_spec_harness.git
cd rales_engine_spec_harness
bundle
export BASE_URL=http://rales-engine-1710.herokuapp.com
```
Run the tests with `bundle exec rake`
